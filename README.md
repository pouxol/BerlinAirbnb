# BerlinAirbnb
Analysis of Berlin Airbnb Data

## Project Motivation
Airbnb is changing the way we travel.
The idea behind Airbnb was to create a sharing-economy where people rent out their appartements when they are away for the weekend for example.
Today people made a business out of Airbnb and rent out appartements all year around.
I want to create a model that predicts the price of the appartements based on the information that is available.

## File Descriptions
insideairbnb.com is an Airbnb-critical website and is not associated with or endorsed by Airbnb.
The data provided utilizez public information compiled from the Airbnb-website.
The data is provided individually for different cities.
For the Analysis of Airbnb listings of Berlin I used following files:
* berlinlistings.csv contains detailed information about the listings (Host, Ratings, Property Type, etc.).
* berlincalendar.csv contains different prices for different dates for each property.
* BerlinAirbnb.ipynb contains the code of this analysis.

The dataset can be found [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).

## Results
I analyzed the coefficients of the trained model to find out the impact of different listing-properties on the price of the property.
